## Deep Learning Projects
Deep Learning is a subfield of machine learning concerned with algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain called artificial neural networks. Several approaches in Deep Learning exist, a common one involves the use of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN, or ConvNet) whish is a class of deep, feed-forward artificial neural networks that has successfully been applied to analyzing visual imagery. CNNs use relatively little pre-processing compared to other image classification algorithms.

This repo contains my personal Deep Learning projects which include the use of CNNs.
